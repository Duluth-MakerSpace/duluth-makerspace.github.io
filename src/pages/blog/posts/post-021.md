Check out this project! A haul bag commonly referred to as “the pig” is used in climbing to bring essential items such as food and water up as climbers ascend a rock face.

DMS members decided to make an attempt of El Capitan via the Salathé Wall and in order to climb a big wall they would need a big haul bag. After a local dumpster score of the seemingly appropriate fabric, it was game on for these climbers.
