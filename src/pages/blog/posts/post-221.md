Alyssa and Miranda painted the front doors and old windows.  Looks better.  Matt brought in a new server with a little more power for running our Minecraft server.  Now we have a makerspace minecraft server for our group persistent world.   We also made further progress on improving front desk.  We tested projecting on front of building so we can trace a nice gear logo mural.
