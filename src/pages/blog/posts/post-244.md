Today's make night had some fun projects going on.  Sergio worked on a little arduino motor platform. Matt worked on his 3D printer. Miranda played with an rc kit.  Paul converted a couple servos to continuous rotation. Troy soldered some custom PCBs.  Max got his fancy rgb led strips working. Luke stopped by from Ashland to check the place out and show off an electric imp.  A couple visitors stopped by also.
