Lets give this Duluth MakerSpace experiment in 2015 one great effort to be successful.  Goal would be at this time in 12 months to be membership sustainable against monthly costs.  We've got a lot of work to do in 2015, but also a lot of promise.  There has been good interest and progress so far. Some various notes for 2015:

We have made our first high-end tool purchase with our large 100watt laser to be ready in the next couple months.

We have acquired materials for MANY various creative and crafty classes, along with high-tech gadgetry.  People taking classes is one of the best ways to support our dream.

Our RC/Robotics lab should be open soon.  We will have some member pilot-able crafts.

We will be working on adding store type items in shop for sale soon, both member consignment and commonly needed stocked items.  Another way to support our dreams.

Happy New Years! And a big thanks to everyone that has helped DMS get this far!  It's been a great community effort.
