Our Giant 10'x8' CNC lent by Iconics has just been streamlined with a new flexible bed design, End stops, and an auto-Z plate.  Ready to go into production on cutting plywood parts and even some 3D cutting.  Our 5hp Spindle can make quick work out of most projects.  We will try to setup some classes soon on it's usage.  Otherwise a few members can privately consult to train people in.  Initial Rates will be $20/hr for usage.
