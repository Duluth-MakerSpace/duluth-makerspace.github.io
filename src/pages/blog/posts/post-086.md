Check out this great cribbage board and coffee table made by new DMS member Megan W! It's got storage for cards underneath and it reused the base of an old stool base for legs.

With the idea of a cribbage board cut into a tree round, Megan came to the Makerspace seeking a place to make her idea come to life. What she found was a much larger tree round than she was expecting and decided why not make it a table. With a lot of sanding, router work, and finishing she had the table ready to gift for many a cold winter night to come.

Whats your next project ?
