Another fun creation from member Mike O. This piece was created for the Minnesota State Fair Scarecrow Comp. This sculpture was based on a cartoon character from the 60’s referencing the roaming nature of the  nation at the time. It’s welded out of recycled materials such as muffler, old shoe horns, and various other materials; all creatively assembled at the @duluthmakerspace. Keep on trucking, Mike.
