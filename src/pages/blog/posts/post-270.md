Josh's hand woodworking class is tonight!  Learn about the complex old-school wood surfacing tool, the hand plane.  Josh goes in depth about the best techniques and the tool itself.  You do not have to be a member to take this  inexpensive $10 class. Starts at 7pm tonight and goes for about an hour.

UPDATE: Class went well, four students attended!
