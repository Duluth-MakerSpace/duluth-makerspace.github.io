Hello makers,

The Duluth Makerspace is open and in full function. If you are interested in using the space as a member, we are limited to RFID holding members only, due to limited staffing (To gain RFID access you must take an orientation class and be approved). Additionally, for the foreseeable future we will not be holding classes. As we adjust our norms at the Makerspace to support recommendations by the CDC, we ask you to be understanding as we move through difference phases of reopening. You can expect these health measures enforced by DMS during this time:

1.	Members  will be required to wear masks (cloth or surgical) while in the space

2.	Maximum 25%  building capacity

3.	Established hand-washing protocols for everyone.

4.	Communication regarding any changes, alerts, or issues as we move through this process will be through slack and on the DMS website. Please check these sources for updated details.

Please contact duluthmakerspace@gmail.com with any questions. Thanks everyone for the support! Hope to see you all soon!
