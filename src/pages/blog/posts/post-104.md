As part of a 15 year running event,  Fab Lab Egypt and Fab Lab new Cairo, are hosting the annual gathering for all Fab Labs and maker-spaces around the world. Each year, members of worldwide Fab Labs gather to share and create communities around the different local and global interests regarding digital manufacturing, innovation, and technology.

This year it's gonna happen in Egypt, which has more than 7000 years of making history. This year, they are assembling a large version of the original, an 18" sculpture of Bust of Nefertiti which is currently on display in Germany. As a brief history recap, Nefertiti reigned as queen of Egypt from 1353-1336 BC and may have ruled as Pharaoh after her husbandâ€™s death.

In comes the Duluth Makerspace. Jesse Ferguson, a member at DMS, decided that this would be a cool project to work on and so, took up his share. They will begin to assemble these 3D printed pieces of the sculpture will be built at Fab15, a conference taking place July 28th to August 4th in Cairo and ElGouna Egypt. Congratulations to Jesse for collaborating on this unique project.
