We have always wanted a way for members to be able to sell what they make to our local community. Two Loons Gallery and Boutique has now made that easier! We have partnered with them to have a display that shows off, and offers up for sale, items made by members of the MakerSpace, and they're even located in our same neighborhood, Lincoln Park! Go check them out.
