A belated thanks to all those who sacrificed a Saturday, cleaning and prepping the 2nd floor for upcoming renovations. This is a huge undertaking for the Duluth Makerspace, and is only to be achieved one step at a time. Again, thank you so much to those who volunteered. Check the calendar for upcoming events that will help increase the functionality and aesthetics of our amazing space.
