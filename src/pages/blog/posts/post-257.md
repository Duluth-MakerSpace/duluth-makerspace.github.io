Big group effort today towards completing the Pong Project,  But we just fell short of time.  Sergio did a lot of soldering, Karl did some Pipe Engineering, Chris and Paul did a lot of LED installation, Matt worked on getting the Pedestals wired, Troy helped with troubleshooting, Miranda and alyssa helped a bit when they could, Russ had lent his voice earlier in the day.   Great effort today folks! 10 people working on single project.  nice.    Alyssa & Miranda's Wire Wrap class went well also.
