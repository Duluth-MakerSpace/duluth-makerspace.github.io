Ok, this is it guys! We have received our approved permit plans from the city! Now we can begin our work on the second floor! So what does this mean for you?

What you can do is come on down and help us start working? We need volunteers to start renovating! View the how to video posted in our slack channel (#dms2ndfloorremodel) for more details! Or come on down, this coming Thursday, the 14th for a work day!
