Great experiences await in Lincoln Park! The people who live and work in the Lincoln Park neighborhood know about the great things we have to offer, and we'd like to invite you to a neighborhood Open House.

From Duluth MakerSpace to Frost River and Lincoln Park Middle School to WLSSD, you can test, taste, and experience amenities in the Lincoln Park neighborhood on October 15.

Best of all, you don't have to do the driving. Park near an identified location (look for the bright green balloons) and hop one of the free bannered event buses that will stop at all of the events throughout the day.
