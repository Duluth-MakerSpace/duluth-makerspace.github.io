DMS is temporarily closed for member access.  Volunteers are welcome to come and help work on DMS itself  but starting Wednesday the 12th we are closed for normal member usage for a few days while we cross some I's and dot some T's.   All memberships will be extended by the number of days we are closed.  Thanks for your patience and understanding.  We will update when we know what date we can open back up for full access.
