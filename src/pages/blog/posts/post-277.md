Our first big day of classes were mostly successful.  Chris and Paul's Arduino Introduction went well after some Laptop glitching.  They had 5 people take the class.  One child showed up for Adam's kids class,  which was nice as it gave some time to practice on the nice kid :)  (and parents)  3D Printing class could have been better with the printers still stuck in transport (hopefully arrive in a few days) but the 5 students were patient.  Make a Mini Synth was only attended by Paul and I, but should have been a much more popular class,  as it was a lot of fun.  We will definitely push that one in January when Troy returns.     All in all The feeling was the students had a good experience, just could have had a warmer space and a little better technical setup which will definitely be improved.  Great work everyone!

4 showed up for weekly meeting.  We reviewed classes, discussed safety, and brainstormed on Building Pong group project construction.
