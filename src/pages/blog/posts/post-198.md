Another group project at the shop!   A Wooden sandwich base was made to house the electronics.  An arduino runs the project with custom code that looks for completing 3 different circuits.  A score is determined foremost by not touching the wire while tracing it with the wand,  and secondarily by speed.  It's a fun challenge for all ages.
