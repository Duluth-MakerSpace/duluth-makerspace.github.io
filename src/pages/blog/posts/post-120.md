Another fine piece of work by Duluth Makerspace member, Ian. Its a sturdy build with quite ornate lumber. Padauk (pronounced pa-doo) or Pterocarpus soyauxii is generally sourced form West Africa. Its an elegant orange-brown hardwood tree often grows in small groups and is common in dense equatorial rain forests. The tree grows to a height of 100 feet and possesses excellent weathering properties. You learn something new everyday!
