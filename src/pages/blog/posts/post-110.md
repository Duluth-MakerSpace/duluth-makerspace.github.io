It had been a while since DMS member, Steve, picked up a welder and did some work. To remedy this, he set up a 101 class with one of our metal workers and tuned up his skills. Pictured above is Steve, working on a spot weld.

Do you need to sharpen up those welding skills ?

Or are you a total beginner  with a project in mind ? Let us now and we’ll set up a class at the Duluth makerspace!
