Adam helped put up some painful ceiling sheetrock, thanks! Miranda got our Stocked Items up and labeled for sale. We stock 7 items in the "store" now -
Arduino Uno & Wall adapters

Arduino Nano

A couple Arduino kits

SD card suitable for 3d printers

USB thumbdrives

We Also built a new filament rack to clean up shelving above printers to prepare for consignment/shop production  stuff.  Matt slaved away at building his fancy 3D printer.
