A makerspace project that had to be shared! Following our successful internal fundraiser (2.5k!) for a new multi welder in the metal shop, a need arose for the new cart to hold two gas cylinders. DMS board member and active metal shop enthusiast Mike O. responded to the call with this beauty! A big thanks to all those who donated and to Mike for the custom cart!
