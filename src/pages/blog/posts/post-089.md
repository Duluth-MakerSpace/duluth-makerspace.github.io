With our old tablet on the fritz, the Makerspace was in need for a new device. Sourced from the community, we procured a new iPad; but it didn't fit our old stand! With the opportunity to create something new, heads were put together and an idea struck. The new stand comprised of a swivel from the old, a new frame and a lot of CNC work from DMS member Randy, turned a unique project.  All in all, a big thanks to all members involved. This kind of creative project certainly highlights the drive that makes this community so great.
