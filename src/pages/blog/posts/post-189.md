We have implemented a custom cooling solution for our lasers.  The requirements were to keep the water cooled lasers as cool as possible,  but above dewpoint!  Tricky.   So,  Arduino with temp and humidity sensors, coupled with a Minifridge with a coolant tank and a cooler with the laser reservoir.  The arduino simply turns a circulation pump on inside of the minifrige cold tank to bring the temp of the laser tank close to dewpoint.  Now we can run our big 100watt laser for hours at a time,  even on warm days.
