We are nearing the end of the renovation of our second floor to host our new pottery and lapidary studio. We are shooting for a deadline in late July to prepare for our open house event during the 1st annual Gitche Gumee Agate festival.

Itâ€™s been a huge project and has taken so many amazing volunteers to get us here. We are beyond excited to have the new studio and make it available to our community.
