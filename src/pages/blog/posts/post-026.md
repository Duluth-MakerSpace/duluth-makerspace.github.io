We are so excited to announce @duluthmakerspace and @shoreviewnatives will be teaming up this summer to bring our community a little bouquet of native prairie and a living sanctuary for our bees!

What does that mean?

@shoreviewnatives helps “home and business owners translation outdoor spaces into landscapes that support aesthetic, ecological, economic, and social goals. They specialize in installing gardens featuring local and regional plant species.” Essentially we get to play postive and active role in supporting our community with our garden!

If your interested in working with @shoreviewnatives, see their website shoreviewnatives.com or message them on Instagram @shoreviewnatives
