Check out this metalshop project from a few weeks ago. Using the metal lathe, Garrett cut a new jib furler for his sailboat. If you've noticed a large van parked in front of the space that would be recently joined members, Min and Garret. While they have been here only briefly, they've made a big splash in the community. They are now headed south for warm weather and, while we are sad to see them go, we wish them the best of luck on their journeys!
