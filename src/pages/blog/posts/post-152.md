Good news, everyone!

After rectifying some code issues and getting the thumbs-up from the city, Duluth MakerSpace is back in business!

We have had to make a few changes to DMS in order to reopen, some only temporary, but we are confident that everything is for the good of the space:

- The pottery and lapidary areas have been removed. That whole area will need to be rebuilt after we file proper permits. If you have any ideas about improvements that can be done on the rebuild, please let us know!

- The large 100 watt laser is out of commission until it can be blessed by an electrical engineer. This should happen in the near future.

- The large CNC machine is also out of operation. Plans for it are still TBD, but one option is to cut it down and finish making a plasma cutter. We may buy a smaller CNC machine to replace this one.

- Any equipment in the woodshop that requires dust collection can't be used until our collection system is set up. We are working with Parsons Electric to complete this upgrade and should be done within a week or so.

We will continuing to make improvements to the building to bring everything up to code as well as making sure we have a welcoming and well-used space.
