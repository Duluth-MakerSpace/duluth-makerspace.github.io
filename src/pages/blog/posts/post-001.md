Who we are:

Duluth Makerspace is a 501c3 nonprofit providing an 11,000 sq foot community multi-discipline industrial, arts, and technology space where members get access to tools and equipment for a small monthly fee. We have acted as an incubator for small business, a workplace for artists, a creative outlet, and a location where ideas can become reality.

Some of our members have been able to find employment, start full or part time businesses, help other small local businesses with creative solutions, as well as build and improve personal “do it yourself” skills due to their learning and experience at our MakerSpace.

Our Mission:

Promote life skills, sustainability, creativity and inspiration by providing access to tools, technical equipment, work space and education to the community at an affordable price.
