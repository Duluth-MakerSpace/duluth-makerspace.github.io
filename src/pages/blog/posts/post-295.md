Bought another nice toy for the shop to arrive by next friday.

Sergio replaced the laser cutters outlet to GFCI. We properly vented the laser cutter to outside now with a high power vent.  We discovered Polycarbonate is NOT a suitable material.  I loaded a bootable USB drive with Ubuntu and attempted to boot the demo WYSE laptop..  It fails to complete startup.  Definitely slow and not a good option.  I also did some critical effort on the LEGO front, determining if we had enough LEGOs to build a table top.   Of course,  in doing this,  We'll use up over half OF the legos..  but priorities.
