5 of us took Saturday and went to visit Nordeast Makers, TC Makers, and American Workshop.   It was very interesting and we learned from all 3 locations that the woodshop is really the main draw.  At our Sunday meeting we decided to double the planned woodshop square footage for this spring/summer.
