Its that time for our annual Member-drive ! We encourage everyone to spread the word and let as many folks know about us as they can. Tell a friend, family member, or coworker all about the space and. All throughout the the month of October, we will be hosting a plethora of classes and special events such as an open house and student night. More details to come! See ya at the Duluth Makerspace!
