Hello Makers! In an effort to help slow the progression of COVID-19, Duluth MakerSpace will not be having public hours for the rest of the month. We will reevaluate for April and update you again then. If you are a member with fob access nothing will change for you, but please maintain the recommended 6' social distances, wash your hands, and stay home if you or a family member is not feeling well. If you are a member without fob access please contact us on slack, via email, or Facebook. Thank you!
