Heres a project from the archives, from a past member, displayed at VAE gallery in North Carolina. She used our 100 W laser to complete her project. The following is her explanation of the purpose of the exhibit.

Eun-Kyung Suh constructed multiple pentagonal and hexagonal boxes that can be arranged next to one another on a wall in appropriate patterns symbolizing ethnic enclaves. Her focus is the assimilation process of immigrants of color and their formation of ethnic concentrations in the settled areas. Immigrants often cluster in close geographic areas and develop migrant networks, thus forming ethnic enclaves. The transitional phase of learning a new language and social norms of the country restricts immigrants’ activities within the enclave and subsequently sequesters them from the larger societal context. These constructed ethnic enclaves include geological patterns from immigrants’ origins to act as havens where their heritage can be preserved and fortified.
