A good couple hours of volunteer work where 4 people showed up and were a great hauling help.  Followed by a good Logo selection meeting which was pretty unanimous. Chris will be working on some variations, but it's a good inclusive, creative logo,  and will make for a great physical sign!  We also discussed kitchen layouts, inclusivity, and touched on funding methods.  Decided  to chase down Russ some day in the next week to have him help explain options with possible SLS integration.
