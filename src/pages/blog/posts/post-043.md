Woah! Check out this great project by new DMS member, Jeremy! After getting in the woodshop, Jeremy has found his groove making handmade projects like this with epoxy paints and live edge timber.

If your interested in buying one these handmade wall pieces, they are available in Duluth at Two Loons and in Superior at Once Again Used and New.
