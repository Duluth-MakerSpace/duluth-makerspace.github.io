Been working hard at DMS! Jerry, Karl, Mikey, Danielle, Miranda, Max, Matt, Pat and Ben helped finish much needed roof repairs above storage area.  Miranda and Paul went to TC Makers Minnie Fair Sunday and ran a table showing out infinity mirror.  Max's Car finally started!  6 months after starting an engine swap!  (Hobby timing)
