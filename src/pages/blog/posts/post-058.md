New DMS members from @turtleharefarm workings on a liner for their yurt! They plan to use this yurt for guest to stay in while touring the farm(see their Instagram for more details). It’s seems as though it’s quite a “big” project 😂. Good luck to these makers, and check our gram for upcoming after photos!
