Reed stopped by for a couple hours and we slapped up two equipment countertops on top of the temporary walls.  These should work well to house our tech equipment for this winter.  Cost under $25 for each.  Also added a basic profile details page, so members can check their volunteer time logs, and the open accounting basic data accessible now.
