Though it was DMS member, Hans, first time in the wood shop; he dove headlong into building a set of croquet mallets for his dad. After getting familiar with one of our lathes and asking a few questions, he was able to turn out a complete set.

If you have a project in mind but are new to the shop world, come on down to the Duluth Makerspace. In addition to a thorough orientation course, we have plenty of resources to get you on the ground running.
