Todays Group Pong Project went a little slower than anticipated.  Alyssa and Chris both put in a good couple hours effort.  Russ recorded some voice content, and Karl helped with CNC cutting a fancy plywood button.  Tomorrow will probably be too busy to finish,  so hopefully Monday we can get the system completed.    YOU CAN 3D PRINT HOLIDAY COOKIE CUTTERS AT Duluth Maker Space!
