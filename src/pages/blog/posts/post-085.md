Duluth Makerspace member, Kyle C, learning how to run one of our industrial sewing machines. In addition to this machine, we also have anther walking foot sewing machine and industrial surger machine.

Interested in putting together that canvas tent for winter camping, or fixing the boundary water pack that you've had for year? Come down to the Makerspace and use our industrial sewing room!
