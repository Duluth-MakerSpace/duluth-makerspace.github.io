Today's rubber stamp class went well with 3 students attending.  Welcome Austin, our newest paid member who checked the place out for a bit and dove into some Arduino code.  Paid member Wulfgar volunteered to rebuild our Lego Logo with his wife.  Still fighting heat in the building,  hope to get stuff sorted ASAP.
