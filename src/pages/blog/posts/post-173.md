I lied!  the 100w laser CAN cut metal.   Every tour I've ever given I've said it cannot affect metal.  Did a test recently and it can cut .1mm stainless steel,  (Almost foil!)  However, it is very slow, and a pretty horrible finish :)   So,  It was a mostly-true statement.    Still,  It may be fun for some artsy project.    We need to finish the actual CNC plasma cutter soon, that's the real answer.
