A great project by new DMS member Owen! Meeting the need of a 9 year old boy who is bound to a wheelchair, Owen decided to give him a little more terrain capabilities. By affixing a gaming chair to a high weight capacity wheelchair and installing a larger tire set, Owen was able to make a chair fit for the road less travelled.
