Joe ran up north and collected a bunch of free donated hardware, etc. for our future needs.  Miranda touched up some paint and did a bunch of heavy cleaning.  We got the boiler running and leak-free heating the entry room and upstairs areas.  Now we may need to finish those upstairs offices for the winter :)  Re-did laser cutter's water system better.
