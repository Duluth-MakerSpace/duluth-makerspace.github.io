Had a few light classes today.  Afterwords the bimonthly meeting went well.  We decided to pursue an economical entry into ceramics.  Also dropping auto shop push.  Closing easter.  After the meeting Alyssa and Chris got the big commercial embroiderer working.  So it's finally ready to start being used.  Paul did some standing wave string whipping with a motor. And Miranda practiced some custom embroidery design. Joe setup a servo controlled light-looker, which Alyssa decorated...  Igor.
