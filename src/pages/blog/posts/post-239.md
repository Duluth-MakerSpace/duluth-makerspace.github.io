Busy day with people being productive. Matt was around all day, worked on a web-based camera system and his 3D printer,  and helped with some new laptops.  Paul stopped in to visit.  We had a UMD student come in and interview us. Howard worked on 3D printing and calibrating the DaVinci. Adam played with some mad scientist engineering. New member Steven did some 3D printing also.
