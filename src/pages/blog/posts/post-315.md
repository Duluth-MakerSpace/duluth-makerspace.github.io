The hard-core makerspace makers got a chance to play with the new toys in the almost-working techlab!  Scott and Karl got the laser cutter etching wood nicely. Alyssa and Paul got a new dual extruder 3D printer running.  Chris and Matt helped finish up some desks and other stuffs.  It was fun to finally have some toys!   Shop will be open most nights now in a beta-testing for going proper-live open this weekend.  So feel free to come down and play with toys or help get stuff ready.
