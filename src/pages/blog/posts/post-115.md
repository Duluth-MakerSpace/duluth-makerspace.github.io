DMS woodworker, Ian has been hard at work. As of late heâ€™s completed a bed frame, coffee table and side table. Using the scraps from these projects he is now on to another project! Ian is using the lathe to carve  new handles for his chisel set using the left over wood from his project. Way to stay creative!
