Photos from our demo night. All the talk was had about 3D uses of the x-carve cnc machine. Using these applications, Paul did some neat prototyping of a fin for his surf board .

We hold a demo night the first Wednesday of every month. Itâ€™s free and open to the public, so come on down the next time !
