Today's open house went perfectly, we had roughly 20 new faces swing by.  Both the laser cutter and dual extruder were busy turning out sample trinkets and a perfect amount of people showed up so it was easy to speak with everyone.  I think we generated a good level of interest for this point in time!   Thanks to everyone!
