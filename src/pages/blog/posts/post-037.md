A couple years ago or so, this vintage industrial stool lived in the DMS metal shop. The seat was ripped, the padding was shot.

Saving it from the dump, Mike O. decided to give it new life. Working with a designer friend, he was able to recreate a wonderfully functional chair for his new office space! Well done!!
