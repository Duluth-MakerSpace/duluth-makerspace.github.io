Menards rents trucks $20/hr.  nice.  Works great for materials transport to shop. Mike and Joe got materials needed to replace some damaged sheetrock,  and build temporary walls in door cavities.  Got everything done short of one wall.  Did some spray foam insulating as well.

Will do some final prep in morning for painting tomorrow.
