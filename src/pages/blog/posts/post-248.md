Among all the other cleanups and improvements,  our electronics bench is getting set up better.

HotAir Rework and second quality soldering station.

More componenets, lasers, barometric sensors, tilt, lan, displays, etc!

USB Microscope

USB Oscilliscope

Concentrating work on Robo-Room over the next few days.  As always, if anyone wants to help,  let me know!
