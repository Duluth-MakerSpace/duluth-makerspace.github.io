Due to the lovely weather making travel difficult, last Saturday, we decided to host yet another Open House! Come down &  check out the Duluth Makerspace! We will have tours running, small hands-on demos, and lots of exciting news to share.  Beverages by Bent Paddle and some snacks too. See ya there!
