We had several members in working on stuff.  Welcome to new paid members Sam and Nick!  Several others stopped in to check the place out and some interest in Gift Memberships.  Chris, Sergio and I spent the day working on Radiators, Storage racks, and a microwave shelf.  Three more 3D Printers have finally come in! and the 250 LED addressable lights are in for our Group Pong project!
