Woodshop is ready for use!  We are having an open house on Feb 7th noon-4pm.   Woodshop is legal now, and mostly usable.  Still needs some longer term improvements.   The rest of the space has been continuously improved and is running pretty smooth now.

Stop by for tours/demonstrations and snacks!
