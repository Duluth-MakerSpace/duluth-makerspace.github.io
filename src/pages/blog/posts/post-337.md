10,000sqft! 30th Ave West Superior St. Duluth, MN! An empty building now, but Classroom, TechShop, WoodShop, MetalShop, +More, +More in the future!

We had 2 hours volunteer cleanup work, and then a Pizza and Name selection event with a gathering of a dozen dedicated supporters! - Duluth MakerSpace.  This website was started.
