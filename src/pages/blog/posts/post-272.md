Quite a few interested members showed up tonight to discuss woodworking shop machines and layout objectives.  It was a good start,  but it will be a long process!  Matt, Paul, Chris and Joe  spent several hours "making" at the shop today,  it was great :)  Box Stuffers!  3month and 6month Gift certificates available down at the shop now ($75/$150)  We 3D print a "perspective initals"  For Duluth Makerspace (D one way, M the other) And  roll a card in it.  Great way to support us and the person you are gifting to with an educational and entertaining opportunity!
