This is part two of a post from a week ago, about a globally conglomerated, 3D printed statue of a Egyptian queen, Nefertiti. She reigned as queen of Egypt from 1353-1336 BC and may have ruled as Pharaoh after her husbandâ€™s death. As part of a long running event, Fablab 15 and  Makerspaces all over the globe, got together and created a statue to represent the deep history of Egypt and its rich culture. Here is the final result and another congrats to DMS member Jesse F. for being a part of this collaboration.  Learn more here : https://www.facebook.com/pg/wethebuilders/photos/?ref=page_internal
