It wasn't cheap,  but it was the best option available and Duluth Architectural Metals did a great job.  The center roof has been given a full new mopped down layer which should last 10 years.  We were able to keep the skylights.   This fully covers the future woodshop area and office area.  We still have work to do over the East Wing but that is far less complicated to roof.
