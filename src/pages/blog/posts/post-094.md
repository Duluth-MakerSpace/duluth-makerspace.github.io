With a bike trip planned in the the backcountry trails of the Pacific Northwest, DMS members Max and Devan began prepping what they would carry and how. Deciding that he would need a rack for the front, as well as the back; Devan devised a front rack by recycling an old rear bike rack. The result was quite a dashing front rack with a piece of varnished cedar for the base. Nice Work !
