If we're honest most of the time we dont get it right on the first go as makers. The process of constantly redesigning and progressing to a better product is always rewarding!

Check out this project by Paul from a few weeks ago. After a few iterations of design, Paul was able to print a functioning joint on our 3d printers!

Now heâ€™s just looking for a little sewing help to clean up the fabric! Wanna help?
