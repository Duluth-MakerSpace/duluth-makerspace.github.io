Sometimes you don’t get it on the third try...But if you keep working, you’ll get it!

Check out this cool project! After 5 prototypes, a little sanding, and paint DMS tech manager, Jesse and I, were able to put together a really nice fix to repair this canon zoom lens! These project are always fun as they require a lot of creativity and process to finish.

What project do you have to finish?
