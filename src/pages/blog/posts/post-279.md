Some random work today, along with misbehaving furnace.  It locks up and stops cycling, requiring a hard reset.  Perfect use for an arduino!  Attached a temperature sensor to boiler pipes and then connected a normally closed relay to power furnace.  After 20min if temp is less than 100deg it powers off furnace for 5 min.    Working like a charm.  Temporary solution until we get it repaired.  About 2 hours total work.
