Well,  it's been a couple months of various issues plaguing the RFID system.  We finally today installed an all-new-simpler build that hopefully fixed the several glitches that were occurring.     Apologies for the delay and general frustration.  I personally would make time to go fix it ,  and it would be working those nights,  which makes it difficult to troubleshoot.   By replacing the whole system,  should be solid again.   And We will have on-hand-backups!!  :)
