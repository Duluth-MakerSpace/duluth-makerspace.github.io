David H stopped by a little after 4 and helped with some electrical work. We had a small, 6 member meeting.  Decided the following member related points:

Membership for this winter will be $25/mo including $5 shop credit. ($35 with spouse) The 3d printers will be tracked in an efficient way 5cents/gram  which is deducted from your "shop credit".  at membership renewal, you pay next months due + any shop credit deficit.  Laser will probably be 5 to 10 cents per minute.

Halloween event may be put on hold for this year, unless a good operational idea and interest in running it can be put together.

Proper Opening will attempt to be ready in 2-4 weeks, where we'll make the place as organized, outfitted and professional as we can get it reasonably.  We'd like to have the ~8  PC's ready, several classes scheduled, and safety all squared away.
