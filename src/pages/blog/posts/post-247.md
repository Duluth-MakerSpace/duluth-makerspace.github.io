After too many man hours of work,  the Robo Room is painted. All ready for furnishing.  Scott, Pat, Matt, and Chris helped set up shelving today in the room.  Tomorrow I'll work on getting the center work desk built and the equipment organized.   Full day of classes with light attendance, but they all went well.
