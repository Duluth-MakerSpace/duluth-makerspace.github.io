We are excited to announce that DMS will resume operation as of June 29th.

As we adjust our norms at the Makerspace to support recommendations by the CDC, we ask you to be understanding as we move through difference phases of reopening.

You can expect these health measures enforced by DMS during this time:

1.	Members  will be required to wear masks (cloth or surgical) while in the space

3.	Rearranged workspaces and paths, to help with social distancing.

4.	Maximum 25%  building capacity

5.	Established hand-washing protocols for everyone.

6.	Communication regarding any changes, alerts, or issues as we move through this process will be through slack and on the DMS website. Please check these sources for updated details.

7. Member only access to reduce possible exposure

Please contact duluthmakerspace@gmail.com with any questions. Thanks everyone for the support! Hope to see you all soon!
