Only a few showed up tonight, good thing too since we still had a mess.  We finished moving the Laser Cutter and mostly finished rewiring the desk outlets.  Matt helped add an acrylic screen to the now finished laser status screen.  Chris finished fixing his led Pong game. Paul helped get Foam cutter working.  Miranda worked on assembling a mini RC kit plane.
