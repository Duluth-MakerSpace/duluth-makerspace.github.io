Big shout out to DMS Woodshop Manager, Eric E. for yet another thorough Woodshop 101 class. Itâ€™s great to let your imagination free, to see an ornate chair or cabinet in a piece of oak; however safety in the shop always comes first. Thanks for reminding us how to safety create! More classes coming soon!
