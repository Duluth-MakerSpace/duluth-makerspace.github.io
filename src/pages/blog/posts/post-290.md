Make Night was fun, a few new folks stopped by, Chris and Matt worked on Arduino Wifi, Karl and Paul played with Laser cutting leaves! Scott worked on FPV enabling a little RC car,  but then the magic smoke was stolen from us.. still unsure why.

Prior to Make Night, Bathroom sink plumbing replaced and working, most of countertop installed now.
