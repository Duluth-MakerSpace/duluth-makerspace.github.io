We had three new faces stop by and show interest prior to the 6pm meeting, so that was a welcome surprise!

We didn't have many grand decisions this week:

brainstormed on sign construction.

Decided to move printers to Entry.

Decided to buy two additional tan printers.

Wire management brainstorming.

Bathroom fixup, hot water @ kitchen.

Lots of little things to do to prepare for opening yet!
