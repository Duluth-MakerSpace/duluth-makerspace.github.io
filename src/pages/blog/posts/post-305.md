Nerd Nite was a good time. They put on an interesting show.  One of the presentations was on makerspaces! We discussed working at cross promotions with nerd nite in the future. Chris, Paul, Matt and Miranda and I attended.  Good work mingling guys :)

The biggest roof patch was mostly completed today.  The roof may be ready to be re-sealed soon.   Plan is to get it good enough so that it is leak free till next summer where we can then decide best route.
