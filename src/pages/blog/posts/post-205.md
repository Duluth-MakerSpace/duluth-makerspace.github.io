New laser is in building but remains untested.  We have so many projects needing work.  We've started offering free memberships per 5 hours of labor for those with more time than money.  We also really appreciate any volunteer effort, and it can go towards your ownership of DMS since we are working towards a co-op structure.   Weekdays noon to 5 are best for help, but we will take whatever we can get :).  Everything from cleaning to station building to painting, sorting, etc.   Just shoot us an email @ info@DuluthMakerSpace.com.  Thanks!
