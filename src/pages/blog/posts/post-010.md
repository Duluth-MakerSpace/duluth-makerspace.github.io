Thank you to everyone who turned out for our First Annual Agate Festival this last Saturday. We were beyond happy to host so many curious agate aficionados and locals alike.

We are looking forward to an even event bigger event next year in collaboration with a beer release from @ursa_minor_brewing. Stay tuned for more details! See ya next year!

A big thanks goes out to all of the sponsors for our silent auction donations from makers and local business alike. Thanks you!
