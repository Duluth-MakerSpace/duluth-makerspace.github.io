A joint project between a few of our Makerspace members, here we have prototype plug for cement casting being cut out on our 5’x8’ CNC router. After this prototype is cut it will be lined with a lubricant and filled with cement. The result will be a coffee coaster with a Minnesota state relief in the center.
