Welcome to the Duluth Makerspace a cooperative workshop, run like a fitness gym, where a monthly membership pays for shared access to electronics, wood-shop, metal-shop, tech-shop, crafts room, classrooms, etc! Similar places have been sprouting up across the country. They are a real community asset driving innovation, education and cooperation. Our biggest asset is the other members.

Because our community is our greatest asset, we strive to always build more of it. So this November 30th, we will be hosting an open house inviting all to explore our space. Come on down and give the space a tour and see what sparks you imagination. See more details in the calendar on our website.
