New control board installed on furnace,  hopefully solid now.   1 phase of our 3 phase power went out, causing all sorts of confusion of trying to trace the stange power issues until We realized an entire Panel was off.  Called up minnesota power and they repaired a weak coupler.  New TV mounted in break room.  Looks good.  Now we need a couch bad.
