Ok, we are now mostly done with the physical work on the winter space. Now we need to focus on the usable space, and our offerings before opening.  We'd like to offer several classes to be scheduable at the opening.  We are open to additional discussion,  but are looking for interested teachers in the following:

Hand Wood Tools - Hand Planing - Josh Bailly

Laser Cutter - Rubber Stamp? - need teacher

3D Printers - Printing a downloaded model? - need teacher

Arduino - Simon Says? - need teacher

Other Classes? Jewelry? Crafts?

Class pricing and size negotiable, after materials, 50/50 profit split between teacher/space.  Goals are low rates for introductory classes.
